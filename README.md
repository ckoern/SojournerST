# SojournerST

Firmware for a STM32G4-based closed-loop DC Motor Driver Board written in C++.
The KiCad Project can be found [here](https://github.com/ckoern/SojournerST-hardware)

The code is based on a STM32CubeIDE project including the autogenerated HAL. All application code is moved to the Application directory.
The project can be built using either the STM32CubeIDE or CMake (WIP) which also includes unit tests.

The controller can be interfaced via Uart (binary packets) or SPI.
